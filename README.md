Introduction

Employee satisfaction is a crucial factor in organizational performance and employee retention. This project focuses on analyzing employee satisfaction, performance, and key HR metrics to gain insights into what drives employee satisfaction across various departments. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns that could help organizations make data-driven decisions to improve employee wellbeing and productivity.

Tools Used
	•	SQL
	•	MySQL Workbench

Project Description

In this project, I explored employee satisfaction across different departments, analyzed the relationship between salary levels and satisfaction scores, and compared employee performance metrics across top-performing and bottom-performing departments. The project involved writing SQL queries to extract insights from the HR dataset.

SQL Queries & Insights

Some of the key SQL queries I worked on include:
	•	Identifying the top three departments with the highest satisfaction scores and the bottom three departments with the lowest satisfaction scores
	•	Analyzing the relationship between Salary and Satisfaction Score
	•	Comparing the top two and bottom two departments across various performance metrics like average evaluation score, project counts, working hours, and promotion rate

Findings

Based on the analysis, the following insights were drawn:
	•	The Management, Product Management, and R&D departments recorded the highest employee satisfaction scores, while the HR, Technical, and Accounting departments had the lowest satisfaction scores.
	•	Employees with high salary levels showed higher satisfaction scores (0.637) compared to those with medium (0.622) and low salary levels (0.601), indicating that salary might have a positive impact on employee satisfaction.
	•	The top-performing departments consistently had higher average evaluation scores, project counts, and working hours compared to the bottom-performing departments. These departments also had a higher promotion rate over the last 5 years, which could contribute to better employee satisfaction.

Conclusion

This project highlights how salary, performance metrics, and promotions can significantly impact employee satisfaction. The insights from this analysis can help HR departments develop better employee engagement strategies, improve satisfaction rates, and ultimately reduce employee churn.
